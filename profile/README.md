# Terronex

**Neural Memory for AI Systems**  
Pioneering the next generation of AI memory architecture through biological inspiration and breakthrough performance.

## The Evolution of AI Memory

Terronex has been at the forefront of AI memory innovation, evolving through groundbreaking formats that have pushed the boundaries of performance and capability:

**AIF-BIN v1 → v2** laid the foundation with portable, offline AI memory storage  
**Engram v1** revolutionized the field with neural-inspired architecture and 400x performance gains

## Engram: Our Neural Memory Breakthrough

Inspired by biological memory traces (engrams) in neuroscience, **Engram** represents a paradigm shift in AI memory systems:

- **400x faster search** — Sub-millisecond retrieval (0.3ms average)
- **Neural architecture** — Hierarchical memory trees with temporal intelligence
- **HNSW indexing** — O(log n) complexity for massive scalability
- **Production validated** — 93.3% recall accuracy across 340+ real-world sessions
- **Multi-modal support** — Text, images, audio, and structured data

### Technical Achievement
From linear O(n) brute force to logarithmic O(log n) graph traversal — a fundamental breakthrough that makes real-time AI memory practical at scale.

## Why AIF-BIN Remains Relevant

While Engram represents our cutting-edge research, **AIF-BIN continues to serve critical needs**:

- **Proven stability** — Battle-tested across thousands of deployments
- **Complete ecosystem** — 8 SDKs, 40+ integrations, desktop tools
- **Universal compatibility** — Works everywhere, minimal dependencies
- **Developer-friendly** — Simple APIs, extensive documentation
- **Open source foundation** — MIT licensed, patent-pending innovations

**AIF-BIN provides the reliable foundation while Engram pushes the performance envelope.**

## Philosophy

**Memory should be intelligent, not just storage.**

Traditional vector databases treat all memories equally. Real intelligence requires temporal awareness, hierarchical organization, and contextual retrieval — just like biological memory systems.

Terronex builds AI memory that thinks.
