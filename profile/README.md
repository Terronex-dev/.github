Building **AIF-BIN** — a portable AI memory format.

Store documents, embeddings, and AI context in a single file. No servers, no databases, works offline.

## What is AIF-BIN?

AIF-BIN is a binary format that packages semantic memory into a single portable file. Think SQLite for AI memory — but with built-in vector search, no external dependencies, and works completely offline.

**Core features:**
- Single-file semantic memory (`.aif-bin`)
- Embedded vector search — find by meaning, not keywords
- Privacy-first — your data stays local
- 8 SDKs: Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C#, Java, Swift, Kotlin
